ServerOne and ServerTwo:
Install openssh-server:
~$ sudo yum -y install openssh-server

ServerOne: Generate private/public rsa key pair
~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Go to directory: .ssh/
~$ cd .ssh/
.ssh$ ls
The files id_rsa(private key) and id_rsa.pub(public key) are created. 

Change id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys.
.ssh$ cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys

Change permissions:
.ssh$ chmod 600 authorized_keys


Go to home directory:
.ssh$ cd 
~$
Copy your Public Key
(ssh-copy-id username@remote_host_ip)
~$ ssh-copy-id vagrant@192.168.1.8

ServerTwo:
Go to .ssh directory
.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys file is created 

ServerOne: Go to .ssh
.ssh$ open id_rsa and copy the content.

ServerTwo, go to .ssh directory and paste the private key content on a file named id_rsa.
.ssh$ vi id_rsa
Paste the content and save.

Change permissions
.ssh$ chmod 600 id_rsa

Now you can log into the remote host without the remote account's password:
(ssh remote_host_ip)
ServerOne ~$ ssh 192.168.1.8
ServerTwo ~$
